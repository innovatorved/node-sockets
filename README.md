# node-sockets

A "scratch implementation" of Node.js based web sockets connections refers to a custom implementation of web sockets using the Node.js runtime environment. Web sockets allow for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. They are often used for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat rooms or collaborative platforms.
